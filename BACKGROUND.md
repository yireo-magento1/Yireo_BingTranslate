# GoogleTranslate or BingTranslate?
Both Google and Microsoft offer computer-based translation APIs. To make the right choice, you need to weigh in a couple of factors. GoogleTranslate charges for every translation you make, while the Microsoft Translation API (formerly called BingTranslate) is free up to a certain limit. Both offer a finejob when translating content, but some users claim that the Google translation is slightly better than the one of Microsoft. To test this, it is best to try out their free web-based version with your own text to compare the differences. Some useful links:
